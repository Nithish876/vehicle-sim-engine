# Under Construction ðŸš§ 
# Vehicle Simulation Engine

A 3D vehicle simulation engine built using Java and **LWJGL** (Lightweight Java Game Library). This engine is designed to simulate vehicle physics and control in a 3D environment. The project aims to provide realistic simulation, including vehicle movement, terrain interaction, and more.

## Features

- **Real-time Vehicle Control**: The engine allows for real-time control of vehicles using both a custom **Android app** for local Wi-Fi/LAN connection or standard keyboard inputs.
- **3D Graphics Rendering**: Utilizes **OpenGL** for rendering a dynamic 3D environment.
- **Physics Simulation**: Simulates vehicle movement with realistic physics calculations.
- **Customizable Terrain**: You can implement various terrain types and adjust the environment for different simulation scenarios.

## Getting Started

To get started with the vehicle simulation engine, follow these instructions:

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure that you have the following software installed on your machine:

- **Java 8+** (JDK)
- **LWJGL** (Lightweight Java Game Library)
- **Gradle** (or an IDE that supports Gradle)
- **Android Studio** (for the Android controller app, if applicable)

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vehicle-sim-engine.git
   cd vehicle-sim-engine
   ```

2. **Build the project**:

   If you're using **Gradle**, simply run:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew build
   ```

3. **Run the engine**:

   To run the simulation locally:

   ```bash
   ./gradlew run
   ```

4. If you have an Android app that controls the simulation, follow the instructions provided in the Android section (you can find the app in a separate repository or a subdirectory).

### Running the Android App (if applicable)

1. **Install Android Studio**: Open the Android project in Android Studio.

2. **Build and Run**: Build and run the Android app on a connected device or emulator.

3. **Connect to the Simulation**: Make sure both the simulation engine and the Android app are connected via Wi-Fi or LAN for real-time control.

## Usage

Once the engine is running, you can interact with the simulation:

- **Keyboard Controls**: 
  - Use the **arrow keys** to control the vehicle's movement.
  - Use the **spacebar** for additional functionalities (e.g., braking or changing gear).
  
- **Android Controller App**:
  - The Android app sends real-time input to the engine over Wi-Fi or LAN.
  - Customize the controls within the app as needed (e.g., steering wheel, throttle, brakes).

## Features Roadmap

- **Vehicle Physics Improvements**: More detailed vehicle dynamics (e.g., suspension, tire friction, etc.).
- **Advanced Terrain Generation**: Ability to generate realistic terrain (mountains, valleys, etc.).
- **Multiplayer Support**: Simulate multiple vehicles controlled by different users.
